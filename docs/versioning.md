## Principles

Wallabagger follow the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/).
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
3. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Beta versioning number

Because webextensions disallow any other character than numeric and dot, we chose to use `.x` as a suffix to mark beta versions.
- Beta version: 1.19.0.0 (**won't** be published on the stores)
- Public release: 1.19.0 (will be published on the stores)
